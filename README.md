## 1. Project Overview
# The breakout game is a simple yet addictive arcade game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. Your goal is to clear all the bricks by hitting them with the ball. Let's get started!

## 2. Installation Instructions
# 1. Clone the Repository:
#    Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
#    git clone https://github.com/your-username/breakout_game.git

# 2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
#    Open a terminal or IDE and navigate to the breakout_game directory:
#    cd breakout_game

# 3. Install Dependencies:
#    Open the pubspec.yaml file and add the following dependencies:
#    dependencies:
#      flutter:
#        sdk: flutter
#      flame: ^1.0.0

# 4. Run flutter pub get to install the dependencies.

## 3. Gameplay Instructions
# Controls:
#  - Use the left and right arrow keys (or touch gestures) to move the paddle.
#  - The paddle will follow your finger or mouse cursor.

# Ball Behavior:
#  - The ball will bounce off walls, the paddle, and bricks.
#  - If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, you lose a life.

# Breaking Bricks:
#  - Each brick has a different color or strength.
#  - When the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears.
#  - Aim to clear all the bricks to win!

## 4. Code Structure
# main.dart: Entry point of the app. Initializes the game.
# game.dart: Contains the game logic, rendering, and update functions.
# paddle.dart: Defines the paddle behavior.
# ball.dart: Implements the ball movement and collision detection.
# brick.dart: Represents the bricks on the screen.
